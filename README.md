# GetTheWine

"Get the wine" is an application meant to help the user decide which bottle of wine they should choose. The user should be able to use the application to scan the bottle of wine and get extra information about it. The information can consist in available ratings/reviews, description about the wine type, or even recommandation for the event where the chosen wine should be used. An account is necessary to store a list of favorite bottles of wine.

I'm not a connoisseur of wine and i don't know much about it. I don't know which countries are best for which kind of wine, or what wine should i bring to a specific occasion. Many times i go to supermarket with the thought of buying a bottle of wine, but when i get to the wine department i immediately change my mind. There are too many wine types, brands and countries of provenance to choose from.
